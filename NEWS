New in version 0.12
===================
Bug fix to convert_CT_image.py, which did not update the list of
tiff files present in the logfile directory. This meant that when
you wanted to convert a MINC file from tiff files that were being
transferred, the conversion would start regardless of whether the
tranfer was actually done.

New in version 0.11
===================
Fixes to the Snakefile. There were inconsistencies that prevented
the MINC files to actually be created.

New in version 0.1
==================
First release with working version of convert_CT_image.py which can
be used to convert TIFF files (potentially being transferred from
the CT scanning machine) to MINC.
